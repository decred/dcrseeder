# dcrseeder

dcrseeder is a crawler for the Decred network, which exposes a list of reliable
nodes via a built-in DNS server.

When dcrseeder is started for the first time, it will connect to the dcrd node
specified with the `-s` flag and listen for `addr` messages. These messages
contain the IPs of all peers known by the node. dcrseeder will then connect to
each of these peers, listen for their `addr` messages, and continue to traverse
the network in this fashion. dcrseeder maintains a list of all known peers and
periodically checks that they are online and available. The list is stored on
disk in a json file, so on subsequent start ups the dcrd node specified with
`-s` does not need to be online.

When dcrseeder is queried for node information, it responds with details of a
random selection of the reliable nodes it knows about.

## Requirements

[Go](http://golang.org) 1.12 or newer.

### Getting Started

To build and install from a checked-out repo, run `go install` in the repo's
root directory.

To start dcrseeder listening on udp 127.0.0.1:5354 with an initial connection to working testnet node 192.168.0.1:

```no-highlight
$ ./dcrseeder -n nameserver.example.com -H network-seed.example.com -s 192.168.0.1 --testnet
```

You will then need to redirect DNS traffic on your public IP port 53 to 127.0.0.1:5354
